# Custom Property Manager

## What is %product%?

Custom Property Manager (CPM) is aimed to provide a management solution to 
custom properties in Blender. By default, Blender does not provide a way for 
users or add-on/extension authors to group related custom properties in the 
UI. Custom Property Manager solves this by visually separating groups using 
UI sub-panels. Properties can be edited to change groups and both groups and 
properties can be rearranged. A button is also added to add a new group 
manually.
